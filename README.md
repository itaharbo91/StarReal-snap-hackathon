# StarReal – Spectacles Hackathon Project

## 🎪 What is a Spectacles Hackathon?

A Spectacles hackathon is a creative challenge where developers and designers collaborate to build innovative **Augmented Reality (AR) experiences** for Snap Spectacles within a limited timeframe.

### The Challenge
Participants create **Lenses** - interactive AR applications that run on Spectacles - using **Lens Studio**, Snap's powerful development platform. These lenses showcase creative use of AR technology to solve real-world problems or create engaging experiences.

### The Tools
- **Lens Studio :** The visual development environment for creating Spectacles lenses
- **Snap SDK :** APIs and modules for advanced features (motion tracking, multiplayer, UI, etc.)
- **Mobile Controller Module :** For precise hand and motion tracking
- **Spectacles Sync Kit :** For multiplayer and collaborative experiences

### The Goal
Transform an idea into a functional, creative AR experience that demonstrates the power of wearable AR technology to enhance how people interact, play, and experience the world.

## 🎯 The Big Idea

**StarReal** transforms any venue into an **exclusive sci-fi arena** where each player experiences an epic energy saber duel in augmented reality on Spectacles.

Inspired by childhood dreams of epic saber battles with friends, we harnessed the power of Spectacles to bring that memory into the real world. Each player sees, controls, and customizes their own energy saber in first person, engaging in real-time multiplayer duels.

## 🎮 The Experience

### Gameplay
- **Natural Movements :** Intuitive attacks, blocks, and dodges without learning curves
- **Customization :** Each player customizes their saber (hilt, color, style) directly on Spectacles via on-lens UI buttons
- **Real-Time Multiplayer :** Live duels in a shared playspace with synchronized saber physics

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Spectacles UI Kit :** On-lens UI buttons integrated into Spectacles for saber customization
- **Mobile Controller / Motion Controller Module :** Uses the paired phone as a tracked controller with 6DoF precision for saber movement
- **Spectacles Sync Kit :** Shares player states and saber data within a single shared playspace

### Technology Stack
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Snap SDK for Spectacles
- Spectacles Sync Kit for multiplayer
- Motion Controller Module

## 🚀 Future Evolutions

1. **Realistic Collisions :** Integrate physical saber collisions so every hit feels visceral and visible
2. **Scoring System :** Clear scoring tied to clean hits and solid defense mechanics
3. **Durability Progression :** Sabers with varying durability that break after impacts, triggering new sabers with different properties for continued engagement
4. **Historical Themes :** French Revolution, Samurai era, and beyond

## ✨ Takeaway

**StarReal** lets users experience a real saber battle with a weapon that feels personal. It showcases how AR can power social, physical experiences that transform everyday moments into extraordinary memories.
